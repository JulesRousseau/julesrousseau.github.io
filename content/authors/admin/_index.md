## About Me

I'm currently finishing my Master II internship in the research labs of Inria/Irisa at Rennes supervised by [André Schrotteloher](https://andreschrottenloher.github.io/) and [Patrick Derbez](https://people.irisa.fr/Patrick.Derbez/). I focus on searching cube attacks on symmetric algorithms including the [Ascon-128](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/lightweight-cryptography/documents/round-2/spec-doc-rnd2/ascon-spec-round2.pdf) authenticated cipher. A huge part of my work is to model the ciphers in MILP (Mixed Linear Programming) to search for integral distinguishers.
