Here's a slightly different project I did in my spare time. I integrated some html scripts into a Genialy slideshow to create a little escape game. Of course, the subject is cybersecurity but it's designed so that **anyone** can do it. It may take a little time to complete. So... give it your best shot!


<div style="width: 100%;"><div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 0; height: 0;"><iframe title="ESCAPE GAME" frameborder="0" width="1200" height="675" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="https://view.genially.com/63c2f903fe2949001a36ccf9" type="text/html" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="yes" allownetworking="all"></iframe> </div> </div>
